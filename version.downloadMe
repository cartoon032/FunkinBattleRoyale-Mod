1.0.0-U31;
- Port several Psych Engine note types(add camzoom, set camzoom, hey, camflash and screenshake). Their values should be the same as Psych engine to keep compatibility
- Input optimisations
- Fix some bugs regarding scrolling
- Finally fix FinishSubState not waiting for win/lose animation to play
- Partially(?) fix the issue with characters not playing idle animations properly
- Finally add a fullscreen option and make F11 work game-wide instead of just on titlestate

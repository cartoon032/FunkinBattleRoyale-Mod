# Super Engine - T Mod
Originally this mod was only for Pull requests to main but at some point, I add too much crap and the original author was not a multi-key player herself
so she asks me to maintain the mod myself
some notable feature
- Multi Key from 1K-18K + 21K
- Better online mode
- support for more chart type
- (hopefully) a smoother Mid Song Mania Change.
- support for Leather Engine multiple Characters with a bit of edit in the chart file.<br>
    this doesn't mean multiple characters character it just allows the chart to load more characters and use notetype to assign who sings what note
- a probably better Chart Editor
- More customization Discord RPC
- and a lot more

I'm now trying to get into a habit of pushing a commit in a smaller chuck and more frequently[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Compiling
- Follow the guide on the Funkin GitHub page [here](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin#build-instructions), this should be completely compatible with that guide

# Read mods/readme.txt for info about custom characters, charts, stages and more. Custom characters and charts beyond vanilla charts, bf and gf SHOULD NOT be hardcoded into this engine

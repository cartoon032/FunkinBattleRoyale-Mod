# Super Engine - T Mod
Originally this mod only for Pull request to main but at some point i add too much crap and the original author not a multi key player herself
so she ask me to maintain the mod myself
some notable feature
- Multi Key from 1k-13k
- Song Speed *slow down is broke ._.''*
- Discord RPC
- and alot more
<br>[Discord server](https://discord.gg/28GPGTRuuR) *this the same invite link to SE discord*

<br><br>Note that due to how i am,most of the time i release update to my friend and forgot to commit the said update
<br><br>So if you want an update or have a suggestion DM me on Discord NayToon#9001 I'm up most of the time
<br><br>also i commit in a one mega commit that got everything in it so it might look like i don't do much but i did alot
